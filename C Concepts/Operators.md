### Assignment Operators
```
= -> assign
+=
-=
*=
/=
```
eg:
```C
int x = 10; //= assigned x its value i.e 10
int y = 20; //= assigned y its value i.e 20
y += 1; //1 is added to y
y -= 1; //1 is subtracted from y
y *= 2; //y is multiplied by 2
y /= 2; //y is divided by 2

```
### Unary Operators
```
++i -> Pre-increment
--i -> Pre-decriment
i++ -> Post-increment
i-- -> Post-Decrement

```

### Comparison Operators
- > → Greater Than
- < → Less Than
- > = → Greater Than or Equal To
- < = → Less Than or Equal To
```C
printf("x < y = %d", x < y); //the answer will be x<y=1(True)
printf("x > y = %d", x > y); //the answer will be x>y=0(false)
```
### Equality Operators
- == → Equal to
- != → Not Equal to
```C
x == 0; //answer will be 0(false);
x !=0; //answer will be 1(true)
```
### Logical Operators
- && → AND
- ||   → OR
- !    → NOT
```C
x < y && x != 0 //answer will be 1(True)
x > y || x != 0 //answer will be 1(True)
```
