![[Perceptron.png]]
To understand perceptrons, we have this diagram in front of us. 
In here, P is a perceptron and “Better Salary” and “Travel Time” are binary based inputs. 
Here, those inputs are being multiplied by weight which is set according to the importance of the input to determining the prediction. Like for this example: 
Better Salary is more important than travel time, so it has a higher weight. 
Then in the perceptron we will add the weight and will see if it’s higher or lower than the pre set threshold. if it’s higher, the prediction is positive, else negative.
