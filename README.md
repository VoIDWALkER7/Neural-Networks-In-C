This is the collection of my notes for nerual networks in C ( I know the neural network part is still missing, i will be adding that in shortly). 

New notes will be updated as soon as i am done with it. There's an order to start with reading the notes in each folder which is as follows: 

  - For ```C Concepts``` start with ```Hello World.md```
  - For ```Deployment, Compilation, Updatation, Automation``` start with ```Make Files.md```
  - For ```Necessary Information About Computer``` start with ```CPU Architecture.md```
  - For ```Snake Game Using C & SDL2``` start with ```SDL2.md```
  - For ```Neural Concepts``` start with ```Perceptron Basics```

At the end of each file that you complete, you will be able to see the file that you are supposed to read after that, and the file that was before that for easy navigation.

You can read the notes on github only but if you want to read it offline, you can download the notes from the drive link given below and then can read it using any Markdown editor like Obsidian(preferably). You can simply clone the github but due to backlinking, it will be pretty annoying to edit it, so you can just use the drive to download.
